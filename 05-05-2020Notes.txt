	   Object Oriented Programming

- Computer Programming Systems which are commonly used in real-world application development are classified into 3 major types.
	a) POPS
	b) OBPS
	c) OOPS

POPS: 
- Process Oriented Programming System
- It supports low level features
- It can directly interact with hardware services.
- It uses very less memory
- It is faster
	Ex: C, PASCAL, COBOL etc..
- Code re-usability and separation issues
- extensibility issues
- no dynamic memory allocations

OBPS:
- Object Based Programming System
- Supports Code-reusability
- Dynamic Memory allocations
- Supports code - separation

   Ex: Visual Basic, JavaScript [now supports OOPS]

- Extensibility issues
- Not support dynamic poly morphism
- no Inheritence

	JavaScript - Brendan Eich - MDN

OOP
- Object Oriented Programming System
- The concept of "Object" into computer programming was introduced in early 1960's by 
 "Alan Kay".
- Object comprises of data and logic
- In early 1967  "Johan Olay & Kristian Nyaggard"
- The first OOP was formulated with a language called
	"SIMULA 67"
- OOP Introduced Code Re-usability
- Later in 1970's "Trygve" introduced a new Framework which supports code separation. The framewor was named as "MVC". [Model View Controller].
- MVC was first formulated with "Small Talk"
- 1975  C++
- 1990  Java

Features of OOP:
1. Code Reusability
2. Code Separation
3. Code Extensibility
4. Mantainability and Testability
5. Loosely Coupled architecture 
6. Code Security

DrawBacks of OOP:
1. Legacy library
2. Complex in configurations
3. Uses more memory
4. Slow
5. Can't directly interact with hardware services.

Characterstics of OOPS:
1. Class
2. Object
3. Inheritence
4. Polymorphism
5. Abstraction
6. Encapsulation


         *TypeScript is completely OOP Language*
