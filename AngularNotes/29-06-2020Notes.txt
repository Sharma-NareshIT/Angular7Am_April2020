		Angular Pipes
		============
- Angular have to present data that comes from various data sources.
- The datatype supported by angular is not similar as the data source provided to application.
- The data will not be presented in the same format that we are expecting.
- You can transform the data into various formats by using "Angular Pipes".
	"Transforming Data using Angular Pipes"
- Pipe is a TypeScript class which implements "PipeTransform" base class.
- Pipe provide a "transform()" method that transforms your data.
- Pipes are used to transforms and format strings, currency, dates and other display data.
- Pipes are uses on template expressions by using "|"

	{{ yourData | pipeName | pipeName }}

- Based on when a pipe is applied to data, Pipes are categorized into 2 groups
	a) Pure Pipe
	b) Impure Pipe
- Pure pipe is the pipe which applies the transformation when any change detected in value or by passing a parameter into pipe.

- Impure pipe is the pipe that applies the transformation on every change instead of verifying the parameter.

- Angular provides several built-in Pipes and also allows to create custom pipes

	        "Angular Built - in Pipes"

- AsyncPipe
- CurrencyPipe
- DatePipe
- DecimalPipe
- I18nPluralPipe
- I18nSelectPipe
- JsonPipe
- KeyValuePipe
- LowerCasePipe
- UpperCasePipe
- TitleCasePipe
- PercentPipe
- SlicePipe


1. UpperCasePipe  : It converts all letters into uppercase.
2. LowerCasePipe  : It converts all letters into lowercase.
3. TitleCasePipe     : It converts every word first letter into
		uppercase.

   Syntax:
	{{ yourData | uppercase }}
	{{ yourData | lowercase }}
	{{ yourData | titlecase }}

4. DecimalPipe :  It is used to display numeric value with
	            thousands separator and fractions.
	            Decimal Pipe reference name is "number".

Syntax:
{{ data | number:{minIntegerDigits}.{minFractionDigits}-{maxFractionDigits}

EX:
	public price = 45000.40;

	{{ price }}   		// 45000.4
	{{ price | number }}		// 45,000.4
	{{pirce | number: '5.2-2' }}        //  45,000.40
