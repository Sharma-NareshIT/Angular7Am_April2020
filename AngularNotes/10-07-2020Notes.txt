		Angular Routing
- Routing is a technique used in web application to configure User and SEO friendly URLs
- User friendly URL allows user to access or query any content directly from URL.
- SEO friendly URL allows Web Crawlers to identify the exact location within the resource.
- Routing uses asynchronous technique using Ajax calls that allows to load new content into page without reloading the complete page.
- In SPA application user can stay on one page and access everything from the page.
- The library  "@angular/router" provides modules
	a) RouterModule
	b) Routes
- Routes is used configure a set of routes for application.
- RouterModule is used for loading routes into RouteTable.
- A Router Module is requried in application that configures and loads the routes on startup.

Syntax:
	         "app-routing.module.ts"

import { NgModule }  from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

const routes : Routes = [ ];    // configured routes

@NgModule({
      imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
      exports: [RouterModule]
})

export class AppRoutingModule { }

- Routes is a collection of routes for your application, which comprises of several details like:

 Router Property		Description
==================================================
 path		It is the request path used to access
		any resource. Path is used in URL.

 component	It refers the component to  be rendered
		when path is requested.

 redirectTo	It specfies the path for redirection 
		dynamically.

 pathMatch	It specifies the url to access when
		requested path is similar to an existing
		page.

 children[]		It is a collection of child routes.

- When a path is requested from URL the resulting component is rendered into startup component at a specific location, which is defined by using the directive:
	<router-outlet> </router-outlet>

- WildCard routes
	{ path : '  ' }	→ Not requesting anything
	{ path : '**' } 	→ Requested path not found



Ex:
1. Add following components
	> ng g c shoppinghome
	> ng g c electornics
	> ng g c footwear
	> ng g c fashion

2. Goto "app" folder and add a new file
		"app-router.module.ts"
